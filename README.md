# gcal-filtered
I had a google calendar from the lab I work in with all the annual leaves, lab meetings and other events filled out.

However, it was cluttering up my own calendar. What I really was interested in having all the time would be the lab meetings, everything else I could hide until it was necessary.

So I wrote a quick node server that will parse the google calendar feed and filter it on the lab meeting events, so I can add it as a new calendar.

`webcal://<server>:3000`
